9/14/2021 - added in introduction, executive summary to SDS
9/16/2021 - added in  system overview, design constraints, future contingencies, document orginization, and project references to SDS
9/22/2021 - Added in purpose, intended audience, and product scope to SRS
9/24/2021 - Helped Build the BOM for hardware needed.
9/30/2021 - Presented sprint 1 final findings and demo of current work
10/4/2021 - Built begining arduino code, gave skeleton of functionallity, sent in purchase order for all of the harware needed for the project
10/6/2021 - researched and found library for the special feedback servo being used and implimented it into skeleton code
10/12/2021 - Added error detection in arduino code so it will not send wrong values to the servo
10/14/2021 - wrote instructions for adding arduino library, pushed first draft of arduino code the github
10/19/2021 - Worked on building definitions for test plan for testing types, passing definitions, and which requirements met which definition of testing. Also defined suspension criteria and resumption plan
10/24/2021 - Worked on getting python serial setup, getting arduino to send messages, and get the Raspberry Pi to recieve thm. Hoever, issues prevented arduino from getting code uploaded to it.
10/25/2021 - met with product owner, got arduino to upload and started working on sending serial messages, proper mesasges were sent but could not get 2 values to separate.
10/28/2021 - Sprint 2 presentation and Demo of the serial communication between the raspberry Pi and arduino in prep for recieveing hardware
11/4/2021 - Review of Sprint 2 presentation, looked over feedback for changes to SRS/SDS v2
11/8/2021 - recieved 360 degree servo and instpected it, assembled mounting device for it
11/15/2021 - Disassembled pan-tilt kit to integrate 360 degree servo, and attempted to wire up the arduino to test, however the proper cable was not present so we could not test. also helped with making the ground station mounting base plate
11/16/2021 - Scrum meeting, discussed new hardware plansnow that all the parts have arrived.
11/18/2021 - Scrum Meeting, worked on final plan for what will be turned in
11/23/2021 - Worked on servos, got angle servo to work, had issues with azimuth servo not working properly, crashed computer. Made new code to troubleshoot and started going through each function on its own to find out issues.
11/25/2021 - continued to troubleshoot azimuth servo, got it and the angle servo to work and made a zeroing function. The angle serve suffered from bad servo flutter which is the next thing to be worked on.
11/26/2021 - Made edits to my sections of the SDS and SRS based on feedback from professors
11/28/2021 - made references bibliography for all documents for SDS and SRS, updated slides for final presentation
11/29/2021 - worked with team to troubleshoot the robotic arm after it broke, removed a capcitor to try and fix it with no luck. Worked on and got the rotator to work properly over serial communication
11/30/2021 - fixed arm with team, worked on making videos of the differnt prts for the final presentation, worked on final integration between each part
12/1/2021 - made videos and pictures of my system to put in the final presentation and the 3 minute video, did a practice final presentation
12/2/2021 - final presentation and comments from the professors
1/18/2022 - Met with team for the first time, laid out possible changes for the semester such as robotic arm simplification, software upgrades, servo weight toleraance increases and ground station weight decreases
1/19/2022 - Met with Liu to redefine new project goals based on team conversations, brought in the notion of the attenuator, change of earth ground statation, use of a single arduino to control both the ground station and the earth
1/22/2022 - Discussed with team ideas from Liu meeting, decided we were not fully clear on the objective and sceduled another meeting with him 
1/24/2022 - met with Liu, better understood need of project being a module that uses the came communication protocols that interface with the orginional MIT based project, worked on the idea of how the attenuator would operate to help fake the signal based on the angle in relation to the fixed object in space
1/26/2022 - met with the team to divy up tasks, I was assigned attempting to run 2 serial ports through 1 arduino, also needs to be able to use the rot2prog protocol that was requested by Liu
1/29/2022 - began research for code on arduio/wiring setups to run 2 serial ports off the same arduino
1/31/2022 - read through rot2prog documentation to understnd its implementation on the arduino code for serial communication
2/1/2022 - gave project updates to Dr. Wang, worked on schedule for when people are coming into class to make sure there is someone to represent the team each class time
2/3/2022 - Reviewd and made changes to the V1 SDS/SRS documentation to be sumbitted. Changed out goals for the current semester
2/7/2022 - worked on project update presentation to be presented on 2/8/2022
2/8/2022 - presented project update with product vision for the upcoming semester
2/10/2022 - Completed Peer Evaluation
2/14/2022 - worked on initial servo setup and calibration with the arduino, met with Dr. Liu about progress on the project
2/22/2022 - further work on servo calibration witht he arduino
2/23/2022 - Made most of the major changes to the test plan for the new changes this semester
2/27/2022 - worked on final revisions for test plan
2/28/2022 - worked on arduino code implimeting servo movement with serial
3/2/2022 - assembled servo setup
3/6/2022 - Worked on SRS/SDS V2 fixing erros reported to us from the TA
