* Robot arm has radius of 280 mm 


October 24th 2021
* I am working on the myCobot Python code and am coming up with ideas on how to make the coordinate system overlap with latitude and longitude
* Because the MyCobot robot isn’t here I will develop a test plan and test code to develop the latitude and longitude coordinate system.
* Began fixing skeleton code 
* Designed plan that would have joint 1 be the core and rotation of the earth
* Radius taken at 90 degrees will be the equator of robot
* Use data received to make a latitude longitude system.
